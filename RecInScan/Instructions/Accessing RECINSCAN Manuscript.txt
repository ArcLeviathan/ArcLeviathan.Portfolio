Look for a file named something like:
RECINSCAN Manuscript.pdf

Double-click the PDF file to open it.

The file should open in your default PDF reader (such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or your browser).

You can also save a copy of the PDF to your computer by right-clicking the file and selecting "Copy", then pasting it into a folder on your desktop or documents.

Troubleshooting

Make sure your PDF reader is installed and up to date.

If the file doesn’t open, try right-clicking it and choosing "Open with" > [PDF reader].
